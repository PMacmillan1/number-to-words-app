# Number-to-Words Application

This application processes text files to extract numeric sequences and converts valid numbers into their word equivalents. Invalid numbers are flagged with the message `"number invalid"`. 

The solution is implemented in Python and includes:
1. A Jupyter Notebook that defines and executes the core functionality.
2. Test files to validate the application with real-world examples.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a solution to process text files by:
- Identifying standalone numeric sequences using regular expressions.
- Converting valid numeric sequences into their English word equivalents (e.g., `123` â†’ `"one hundred and twenty-three"`).
- Flagging invalid numbers (e.g., `12,34`, `23.5`) with the message `"number invalid"`.
